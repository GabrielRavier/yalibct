Split up test-lib/portable-symbols/internal/gnulib/attribute.h

Go make a patch to fix absence of UTIME_OMIT and UTIME_NOW in dietlibc.

File an issue for cosmopolitan namespace violations like timespec_cmp or FRAMESIZE - (see also timespec_cmp_avoid_cosmopolitan_namespace_violation and FRAMESIZE_avoid_cosmopolitan_namespace_violations)

Go ask ATF people why they're passing around const atf_error, they really wanting the pointers to be const and not the pointed-to stuff ?

Try to use Copilot to generate some testcases

Check if nanoprintf's default snprintf behavior conforms to the standard - They seem to screw up truncation by default...

See later if we can get the project working on musl-clang once it doesn't randomly error out anymore (would be nice if it didn't give me 300 warnings before then too - they seem unrelated to the root issue that musl-clang somehow doesn't know about x86intrin.h even though it effectively advertises support for it...)

Add in new tests from glibc:
- stdio-common/tst-printf-oct.c
- update stdio-common/tst-printf-binary-main.c with 2d4728e60621c8844ec679291aa5458c622d8f4f

Grep files for stat

Search GitHub and other code search services for already done functions

Change CMakeLists to specify the minimum POSIX version for each of the PSOIX symbols
Also make it so that stuff from SVID found in CMakeLists libc_symbol tests error when not found with appropriate options for this

Functions to do present in PDP7:
- (list is not complete - anything after stat, I guess)

All the rest of the stuff from PDP7 and anything afterwards

Procedure to find functions usage:
- find ~/src -ipath '*funcName*' >list_funcName
  <list_funcName grep -iE 'tfuncName|funcNamet|/t/|break|m4|unit|gress|integ|bug|ass|xam|te?st|che?c?k' | grep -viE 'netstat|statvfs|lstat|fstat|setstate|pthread_attr_setdetachstate|initstate|tstat|statt|/t/|break|stat[is]|mbstate_t|state|status|llvm|rstat|gcc|[qawhn2ejc]stat|go|python|debug|statp|trace|qemu|getfsstat|statfs|statx|valg|gb|cons|ver|tex|pstat|bench|base|perf|nfs|[mduo]stat|tmpfile|zfs|bin|dev|unbound' | less #parallel -n100000 -- 'grep --color=always -aiE "tfuncName|funcNamet|/t/|m4|unit|gress|integ|te?st|ch(ec)?k"' | awk 'length < 1000' | less

- rg -i funcName ~/src >rg_funcName
  <rg_funcName cut -d: -f1 | grep -v funcName | grep -iE '(config|mak)[^/]*$|\.m[4k]' | sort -u | xargs -d'\n' rg -C10 funcName | bat -p -l c

- Search for them on GitHub/SearchCode and other services
- Use Copilot, basing prompts on standards (also, good opportunity for adding any testcases given out by standards)
- Debian/Fedora file search
