Redo glibc.h test-deps headers ASAP (move test-deps/gnulib/string-buffer.h into test-lib at the same time)

Try to use Copilot to generate some testcases

printf tests just found in nanoprintf (add these ASAP)

Remaining stat tests:

Go make a patch to fix absence of UTIME_OMIT and UTIME_NOW in dietlibc.

File an issue for cosmopolitan namespace violations like timespec_cmp - (see also timespec_cmp_avoid_cosmopolitan_namespace_violation)

Functions to do present in PDP7:
- (list is not complete - anything after stat, I think)

All the rest of the stuff from PDP7 and anything afterwards

See later if we can get the project working on musl-clang once it doesn't randomly error out anymore (would be nice if it didn't give me 300 warnings before then too - they seem unrelated to the root issue that musl-clang somehow doesn't know about x86intrin.h even though it effectively advertises support for it...)
