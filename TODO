Fuzzing stuff from all the previously done functions:
/home/gravier/src/programs/programming-tools/compilers/llvm-project/libc/fuzzing/string/strcmp_fuzz.cpp
(yes there isn't anything else, surprising tbh)
(how tf am I gonna implement -fsanitize=fuzzer portably lmao)

Look at https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/FuzzingLibc
Also https://github.com/novafacing/libc-fuzzer

All the rest of the stuff from PDP7 and anything afterwards

See later if we can get the project working on musl-clang once it doesn't randomly error out anymore (would be nice if it didn't give me 300 warnings before then too - they seem unrelated to the root issue that musl-clang somehow doesn't know about x86intrin.h even though it effectively advertises support for it...)
