Find already done functions usage in .m4 and configure files

Split up test-lib/portable-symbols/internal/gnulib/attribute.h

Go make a patch to fix absence of UTIME_OMIT and UTIME_NOW in dietlibc.

File an issue for cosmopolitan namespace violations like timespec_cmp or FRAMESIZE - (see also timespec_cmp_avoid_cosmopolitan_namespace_violation and FRAMESIZE_avoid_cosmopolitan_namespace_violations)

Go ask ATF people why they're passing around const atf_error, they really wanting the pointers to be const and not the pointed-to stuff ?

Try to use Copilot to generate some testcases

Check if nanoprintf's default snprintf behavior conforms to the standard - They seem to screw up truncation by default...

See later if we can get the project working on musl-clang once it doesn't randomly error out anymore (would be nice if it didn't give me 300 warnings before then too - they seem unrelated to the root issue that musl-clang somehow doesn't know about x86intrin.h even though it effectively advertises support for it...)

Grep files for stat

Search GitHub and other code search services for already done functions

Change CMakeLists to specify the minimum POSIX version for each of the PSOIX symbols
Also make it so that stuff from SVID found in CMakeLists libc_symbol tests error when not found with appropriate options for this

Functions to do present in PDP7:
- (list is not complete - anything after stat, I guess)

All the rest of the stuff from PDP7 and anything afterwards

See also https://code.google.com/archive/p/regfuzz when we get to regex


Procedure to find functions usage:
- find ~/src -ipath '*funcName*' >list_stat
- <list_stat grep -iE 'tfunc|funct|/t/|break|m4|unit|gress|integ|bug|ass|xam|te?st|ch(ec)?k' | grep -viE 'netstat|statvfs|lstat|fstat|setstate|pthread_attr_setdetachstate|initstate|tstat|statt|/t/|break|stat[is]|mbstate_t|state|status|llvm|rstat|gcc|[qawhn2ejc]stat|go|python|debug|statp|trace|qemu|getfsstat|statfs|statx|valg|gb|cons|ver|tex|pstat|bench|base|perf|nfs|[mduo]stat|tmpfile|zfs|bin|dev|unbound' | less #parallel -n100000 -- 'grep --color=always -aiE "tstat|statt|/t/|m4|unit|gress|integ|te?st|ch(ec)?k"' | awk 'length < 1000' | less
- Potentially try to grep files for stat - perhaps try to filter configure and .m4 files for that too
- Search for them on GitHub/SearchCode and other services
- Use Copilot
- Debian/Fedora file search
