Run dos2unix over all files

Try to use Copilot to generate some testcases

printf tests just found in nanoprintf (add these ASAP)

Functions to do present in PDP7:
- stat
- (list is not complete)

All the rest of the stuff from PDP7 and anything afterwards

See later if we can get the project working on musl-clang once it doesn't randomly error out anymore (would be nice if it didn't give me 300 warnings before then too - they seem unrelated to the root issue that musl-clang somehow doesn't know about x86intrin.h even though it effectively advertises support for it...)
