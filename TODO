Get the project working on musl-clang

Add /home/gravier/src/libraries/libc/implementations/libcmini/tests/strcmp/strcmp.c
Add /home/gravier/src/libraries/libc/implementations/libcmini/tests/printf_formatting/printf_formatting.c

Fuzzing stuff from all the previously done functions:
/home/gravier/src/programs/programming-tools/compilers/llvm-project/libc/fuzzing/string/strcmp_fuzz.cpp
(yes there isn't anything else, surprising tbh)
(how tf am I gonna implement -fsanitize=fuzzer portably lmao)

Look at https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/FuzzingLibc
Also https://github.com/novafacing/libc-fuzzer

All the rest of the stuff from PDP7 and anything afterwards

See also https://code.google.com/archive/p/regfuzz when we get to regex
