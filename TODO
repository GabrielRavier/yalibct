Add musl-git configuration.

Find functions usage in .m4 and configure files

Go make a patch to fix absence of UTIME_OMIT and UTIME_NOW in dietlibc.

File an issue for cosmopolitan namespace violations like timespec_cmp or FRAMESIZE - (see also timespec_cmp_avoid_cosmopolitan_namespace_violation and FRAMESIZE_avoid_cosmopolitan_namespace_violations)

Go ask ATF people why they're passing around const atf_error, they really wanting the pointers to be const and not the pointed-to stuff ?

Try to use Copilot to generate some testcases

See later if we can get the project working on musl-clang once it doesn't randomly error out anymore (would be nice if it didn't give me 300 warnings before then too - they seem unrelated to the root issue that musl-clang somehow doesn't know about x86intrin.h even though it effectively advertises support for it...)

Grep files for stat

Functions to do present in PDP7:
- (list is not complete - anything after stat, I guess)

All the rest of the stuff from PDP7 and anything afterwards
