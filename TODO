Remake script file for cosmopolitan (does seem like they've improved stuff...)

Update the .clang-tidy file with the checks from the latest version of clang I guess
Same for new versions of the repos in .pre-commit-config.yaml (see also pre-commit autoupdate)

Try to replace as many includes as possible of compiler-features.h with includes of should-always-be-included.h

Use GitHub Actions and/or something similar for CI

File an issue for cosmopolitan namespace violations like timespec_cmp or FRAMESIZE - (see also timespec_cmp_avoid_cosmopolitan_namespace_violation and FRAMESIZE_avoid_cosmopolitan_namespace_violations)

Make GCC workaround conditional on a flag for it - compiler problems are kind of an issue the user might want to learn about, too

Check man pages for examples (in particular linux man-pages seems to have a bunch of full program examples) - also standards like POSIX or the C standard

Go ask ATF people why they're passing around const atf_error, they really wanting the pointers to be const and not the pointed-to stuff ?

Try to use Bing/Copilot (try the chat version too btw)/ChatGPT/Stampy/etc. to generate some testcases
(note: this includes just not giving it any function to generate tests for - that seems to generate stuff that could be used for testing stuff that involves no libc functions at all)

Version the tests for POSIX functions (i.e. specify which version of POSIX they're from - try to include even very old stuff like XPG)
Perhaps do this for LSB too and all the other standards we can find ?

Check if nanoprintf's default snprintf behavior conforms to the standard - They seem to screw up truncation by default...

See later if we can get the project working on musl-clang once it doesn't randomly error out anymore (would be nice if it didn't give me 300 warnings before then too - they seem unrelated to the root issue that musl-clang somehow doesn't know about x86intrin.h even though it effectively advertises support for it...)

Add minimal implementations for all the tested functions when possible just in case they're not present or something (and test them - probably add an extra config where all the relevant functions are "determined" not to be present in the host system, for testing)

Perhaps try to fix the setvbuf bug in glibc ? idk (see https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17080)

Document the shell scripts in internal/devel-scripts to either contain bug report links or explanations, probably

Add in new tests from glibc:
- stdio-common/tst-printf-oct.c
- update stdio-common/tst-printf-binary-main.c with 2d4728e60621c8844ec679291aa5458c622d8f4f

Add in tests from ArvernOS:
- /home/gravier/src/programs/system/operating-systems/ArvernOS/tests/libc/isdigit.c
- /home/gravier/src/programs/system/operating-systems/ArvernOS/tests/libc/string/strcat.c
- /home/gravier/src/programs/system/operating-systems/ArvernOS/tests/libc/string/strcmp.c
- /home/gravier/src/programs/system/operating-systems/ArvernOS/tests/libc/string/strlen.c

Wtf since when is there a fully public-domain testsuite for POSIX, we absolutely need to get tests from this: https://www.itl.nist.gov/div897/ctg/posix_form.htm


Grep files for stat (...what does this mean, already ?)

Search GitHub and other code search services for already done functions

Add zig cc, dmd and C++ compilers to tested configurations

Change CMakeLists to specify the minimum POSIX version for each of the PSOIX symbols
Also make it so that stuff from SVID found in CMakeLists libc_symbol tests error when not found with appropriate options for this

Deal with loose tests somehow (for example what one can find by doing something like `find -regextype posix-egrep -iregex '.*te?st.*bz.*'` on glibc sources)

Functions to do present in PDP7:
- (list is not complete - anything after stat, I guess)

All the rest of the stuff from PDP7 and anything afterwards

See also https://code.google.com/archive/p/regfuzz when we get to regex

Get this working on:
- all the BSDs
- uclibc
- more obscure libcs
- nolibc
- ccgo (and other "C to something else" converters too)

Periodically update the .clang-tidy file with the checks from the latest version of clang whenever it comes out
Same for new versions of anything from .pre-commit-config.yaml (see also pre-commit autoupdate)


Procedure to find functions usage:
- find ~/src -ipath '*funcName*' >list_funcName
  <list_funcName grep -iE 'tfuncName|funcNamet|/t/|break|m4|unit|gress|integ|bug|ass|xam|te?st|che?c?k' | grep -viE 'netstat|statvfs|lstat|fstat|setstate|pthread_attr_setdetachstate|initstate|tstat|statt|/t/|break|stat[is]|mbstate_t|state|status|llvm|rstat|gcc|[qawhn2ejc]stat|go|python|debug|statp|trace|qemu|getfsstat|statfs|statx|valg|gb|cons|ver|tex|pstat|bench|base|perf|nfs|[mduo]stat|tmpfile|zfs|bin|dev|unbound' | less #parallel -n100000 -- 'grep --color=always -aiE "tfuncName|funcNamet|/t/|m4|unit|gress|integ|te?st|ch(ec)?k"' | awk 'length < 1000' | less
  <list_funcName grep -iE 'funcName.*[0-9]|cat.*funcName|man.*funcName' | less

- rg -i funcName ~/src >rg_funcName
  <rg_funcName cut -d: -f1 | grep -v funcName | grep -iE '(conf|mak)[^/]*$|\.m[4k]' | sort -u | xargs -d'\n' rg -C10 funcName | bat -p -l c

- Look at the POSIX, LSB, SVID and/or C standard stuff for examples - also documentation on various websites like MSDN or even stuff like Oracle documentation
- Search for them on GitHub/SearchCode and other services
- Use Copilot, basing prompts on standards (also, good opportunity for adding any testcases given out by standards)
- Debian/Fedora file search
