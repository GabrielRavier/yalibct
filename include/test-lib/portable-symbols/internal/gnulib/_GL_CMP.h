/* _GL_CMP (n1, n2) performs a three-valued comparison on n1 vs. n2, where
   n1 and n2 are expressions without side effects, that evaluate to real
   numbers (excluding NaN).
   It returns
     1  if n1 > n2
     0  if n1 == n2
     -1 if n1 < n2
   The naïve code   (n1 > n2 ? 1 : n1 < n2 ? -1 : 0)  produces a conditional
   jump with nearly all GCC versions up to GCC 10.
   This variant     (n1 < n2 ? -1 : n1 > n2)  produces a conditional with many
   GCC versions up to GCC 9.
   The better code  (n1 > n2) - (n1 < n2)  from Hacker's Delight § 2-9
   avoids conditional jumps in all GCC versions >= 3.4.  */
