This file contains information on how to make yalibct execute successfully with the current tests on various platforms - the use case this was prepared for is for development of this testsuite to be able to proceed without needing to manually ignore dozens and dozens of errors from feature-lacking libcs every time we want to add a test

It may be useful to others, but it does not seem particularly useful to use it outside of its use-case considering showing defects in libcs is the very purpose of this testsuite
