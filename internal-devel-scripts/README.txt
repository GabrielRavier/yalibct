This folder contains files that build yalibct for various platforms.

The use case this was prepared for is for development of this testsuite to be able to proceed without needing to manually ignore dozens and dozens of errors from feature-lacking libcs every time a test is to be added.

It may be useful to others, but it does not seem particularly useful to use it outside of its use-case given that showing defects in libcs is the very purpose of this testsuite
